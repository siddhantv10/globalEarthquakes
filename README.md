# Visualisation

Used Scattergeo and layout modules of plotly package and json module to create an html visaualisation of global distribution of significant (magnitude 4.5+) earthquakes that occurred in the world in the last month (400+) with location coordinates and magnitude scale


Seismic data was extracted from the US Geological Survey earthquake catalog.
